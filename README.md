Heavy Code Tower Defence.
This is a basic tower defense game where most of the code is related to 3D world grid waypoint allocation and the implementation of a basic pathfinding algorithm;
"Breadth First Search". The rest of my scripts deal with enemy spawning, tower placement and shooting, enemy and tower damage infliction.
i.e: implementation of queues data structure to dequeue() the last of three towers placed and enqueue() the newest requested.
